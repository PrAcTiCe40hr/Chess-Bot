# Chess AI

This is a project to build a chess AI using a neural network and the Minimax algorithm. The neural network is trained on a dataset of historical chess games and then used as the evaluation function for the Minimax algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-ai.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd chess-ai
    ```
3. Install the requirements:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Train the neural network:
    ```
    python train.py
    ```
    This will train the network and save the trained model to a file named 'chess_net.pth'.

2. Run the chess AI:
    ```
    python chess_ai.py
    ```
    This will start a game of chess against the AI.
